Hi there! I am a PhD student at the [Language Technology Lab](https://ltl.mmll.cam.ac.uk) of the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk) and intern at [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/). I do research in Natural Language Processing. Right now, I am especially interested in multilinguality, tokenization and language emergence. I am also interested in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) as a language for writing fast, correct research code. I obtained a BSc in Artifical Intelligence from [Johannes Kepler University Linz](https://www.jku.at/en) in 2023. Previously, I interned at [Cohere](https://cohere.com/), [H2O.ai](https://h2o.ai/) and [Huawei Noah's Ark Lab](http://dev3.noahlab.com.hk) in London. I started out by [being](https://www.kaggle.com/c/petfinder-adoption-prediction/discussion/125436) [active](https://www.kaggle.com/c/petfinder-adoption-prediction/leaderboard) [on](https://www.kaggle.com/c/chaii-hindi-and-tamil-question-answering/leaderboard) [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/bminixhofer).
